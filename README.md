As of 20November2016, I was able to layout the calculator and register button function so that button clicks diplayed within the text field according to their representative text.  The first problem I encountered was that each subsequent button click over wrote the previous action.  I think I needed to "refocus" the event somehow.  What is more, I wanted to parse the string information to int in order to perform the calculations, but I am still becoming familiar with C# syntax and I not sure how to accomplish this at this point.  Overall, this was a good learning experience and it served to get my feet wet utilizing C# and the Visual Studio IDE.
